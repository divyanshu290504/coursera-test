        <h2>Introduction to Python <br></h2>
        <p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
        Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
        as a successor of a language called ABC. &nbsp  Guido remains Python's
        principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p>

        In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
        National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
        in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
        software.
